# Webview Worker Test
> Small app meant to reproduce the errors when creating a worker in Android Webview 130.0.6710.0/130.0.6723.58.

The code works with Webview 130.0.6669.0 but breaks when updated to 130.0.6710.0 or 130.0.6723.58

## Requirements
- Node/npm (I was using Node v18.20.4/NPM v6.14.14 but I don't know if this matters)
- [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) v10.0.0
- Tablet/emulator running Android 9/10/11

## Get Started
- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Run `npm start` to run in browser, `npm run build` to deploy app to device/emulator
